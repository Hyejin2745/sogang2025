Gated clock check  
Net design_riscv_cache_i/riscv_cache_soc_0/inst/u_uart/u_core/u_csr/csr_division_reg[9]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_riscv_cache_i/riscv_cache_soc_0/inst/u_uart/u_core/u_csr/division_reg_reg[9]_LDC_i_1/O, cell design_riscv_cache_i/riscv_cache_soc_0/inst/u_uart/u_core/u_csr/division_reg_reg[9]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
